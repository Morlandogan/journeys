Relationship agreement Morgan and Orlando

Consent to any agreement may be revoked. Flexibility is an integral part of our relationship. Wanting to change things is neither betrayal nor failure. This agreement aims to be pragmatic. This is about the concrete. This is descriptive rather then prescriptive. We aim to keep this up to date.

Relationship principles:

We are choosing our relationship as a life partnership. That means we plan to spend the rest of our lives together.

We are planning healthy interdependence. Shared finances, shared family, shared home, shared chores, shared buisiness, mutual emotional support. We foster self sufficiency and inter dependence both. We encourage each other to have other sources of support. Interdependence does not stop with us. It can extend into broader networks.

We encourage growth in each other. We teach each other things, that one of us knows. We learn new things together.

We are free to explore other connections. We do not limit each other. We do not require permission. Other relationships are free to grow emotionally, physically, practically. At their own pace. Quickly or slowly. Other life partners may exist. We are conscientious about the impact of other connections on our relationship and partnership.


Our planned future together:

Get legally married
Engagement Party in Saarpfalz-Region
Move to Berlin in January 2020
Commitment ceremony in Berlin soon after
Build buisinesses and communities in Berlin
Build a shared home and shared wealth
Have a family in a poly tribe

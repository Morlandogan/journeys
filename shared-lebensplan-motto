The life of the Morganism and Gender-Jen

We are lifepartners.

We are a power couple.

We want to share our journeys in healing, business, romance, sexuality, community and maybe eventually partenting.

We are equals.

We are free.

We are free to pursue other loves, and lives and partnerships.

Our lives are our own, but we are also building one together.

Zusammen.

We are going to Berlin together, and we are planning to do it in january 2020.

We are going to build software and web applications, and (web) communities together.

Morgan knows frontend, Jen knows backend.

We are full stack.

Jen teaches Morgan backend, Morgan teaches Jen frontend.
